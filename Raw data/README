This folder contains raw data from OD600 (Master.csv) and Respiration (12.14.2020, 12.15.2020, and 12.16.2020, separated by day).

Each dataset has an associated R code (in the code branch that extracts the data from the data files and reproduces the analyses presented in the paper).

1. OD600 data is paired with R code: Spec_analyses_Git.R
2. Respirometry data is paired with R code: Respirometry_analysis_Git.R
*Respirometry_analysis_Git.R must be run first
