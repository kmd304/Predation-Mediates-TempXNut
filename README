Predation by a ciliate community mediates temperature and nutrient effects on a peatland prey prokaryotic community.

We investigated the impact of temperature and nutrient levels on microbial communities; researchers examined how predation by ciliate bacteria consumers influenced these communities. A three-week microcosm experiment was completed by exposing predominantly prokaryotic microbial communities to ciliate predators at two temperature scenarios (ambient and +3°C) and two nutrient levels (low and elevated). The results showed that nutrients, temperature, and ciliate presence individually influenced microbial biomass and function. However, their interaction had the most significant effect on the observed changes in microbial community biomass, structure, and function. This study underscores the importance of considering both biotic (such as predation) and abiotic factors (like temperature and nutrient levels) in understanding microbial responses to changing climates and nutrient conditions.
